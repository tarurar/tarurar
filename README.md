Hi there 👋, I am Andrei, experienced Software Developer.

### About Me

I work on projects based on .NET (C#) and Python. 
Currently I am building a trading platform at Lykke Business with lots of microservices.
I am interested in learning functional programming.

I like to do sports (road running 🏃 and cycling 🚴). I used to do triathlon 🏅.

I have a family, I love my wife 👧 and children 🧒🧒🧒.
